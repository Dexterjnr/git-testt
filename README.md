## Overview

In this project, I built a simple QR code that links a user to a specified website. This challenge from Frontend Mentor provided a solid foundation for working with HTML and CSS. It's a great way to practice building small, functional projects that can be embedded into various applications.

This QR code serves as a visual representation that allows users to scan and quickly navigate to the website.

### My Process

### Built With
- HTML
- CSS

### What I Learned
While working on this project, I strengthened my skills with:

Creating simple yet effective HTML structures.
Using CSS for styling and layout, especially when it comes to responsiveness.
Understanding how small projects like this help you build foundational knowledge for larger projects.

### Continued Development
Going forward, I plan to:

Experiment with more advanced CSS properties to make the QR code interactive (e.g., adding hover effects or animations).
Work on enhancing accessibility features such as improving contrast and adding text descriptions for visually impaired users.
Incorporate JavaScript to dynamically generate QR codes based on user input.
